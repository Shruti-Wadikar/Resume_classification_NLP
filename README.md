# Resume_classification_NLP
# Objective: Developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for automated resume classification to streamline candidate screening and selection processes.

An NLP-based machine learning model for automated resume classification, enhancing candidate screening and selection efficiency. This project processes and analyzes resumes to categorize them into relevant job roles using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extracted key insights and visualized word distributions
Feature Engineering: Identified important keywords and contextual patterns
Model Building: Implemented classification models (e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, Deep Learning)
Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
Python (NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn)
Vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
Machine Learning & Deep Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)
This project enhances HR recruitment by automating resume categorization, reducing manual efforts, and improving hiring efficiency. ðŸš€
