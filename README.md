# Resume_classification_NLP
# Objective: Developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for automated resume classification to streamline candidate screening and selection processes.
Utilized Jupyter Notebook to read and preprocess both DOCX and PDF resume files.
Leveraged the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to extract words and their weightage from resumes.
Conducted comprehensive data analysis to gain valuable insights into resume content.
Performed data cleaning and text preprocessing to enhance the quality of extracted information.
Tokenized and vectorized resume text to prepare it for machine learning
Built a machine learning model to classify resumes into predefined categories.
Utilized various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), to train and evaluate the model's performance.
Achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 83.33% with the SVM model.

#Tools and Technologies Used:

Implemented the project in Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Python for data processing and machine learning.
Employed NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
Utilized various libraries for text mining and feature extraction.
Selected Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the primary classification algorithm.
